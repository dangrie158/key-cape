# KeyCape

a simple UI extension for your PC / Mac. 

KeyCape offers the following Hardware I/Os:

* Cherry MX Switch with LED
* Encoder with Button
* 4 general purpose LEDs

As the firmware is still in development I'm not sure yet how to implement all I/O in a good way. Probably a HID Keyboard with the Cherry Switch acting as a ESC button (so vim is usable again for the new Mac Books with touchbar) and the encoder as vol up/down.
